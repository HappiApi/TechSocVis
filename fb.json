End users are, in turn, often unaware of the risk they expose the organisation to by finding workarounds as they believe the organisation values productivity over security. This results in conflict between the security team and the rest of the business, as well as increased risk. We can address this by factoring in an individual\u2019s perspective, knowledge and awareness, and a modern, flexible and adaptable information security approach. Security practices should aim to correct employee's misconceptions by understanding their motivations and working with, not against them \u2013 after all, people are a company\u2019s best assets.\"\n\n\nDemystifying Advanced Persistent Threats:\n\"The cybersecurity term Advanced Persistent Threat ( \u2018APT\u2019) has been widely used as a buzzword for a number of years, and is\u2018responsible for\u2019 or \u2018the means behind\u2019 some of the most notorious cybersecurity breaches. The presentation will attempt to clarify the various meanings of the term, present \u2013 from the viewpoint of the attacker- the typical APT lifecycle, discuss the techniques that make an APT \u2018advanced\u2019 and lastly offer a glimpse on how APTs can be mitigated from the viewpoint of the defender.\"","attending_count":25,"interested_count":34,"id":"1717965211756209"},{"start_time":"2015-12-12T10:00:00+0000","end_time":"2015-12-13T15:00:00+0000","name":"UCLU TechSoc goes to HackKing's 2.0","place":{"name":"Strand Campus, King's College","location":{"city":"London","country":"United Kingdom","latitude":51.512149023141,"longitude":-0.11628923687629},"id":"173466862681854"},"description":"Suffering from HackLondon withdrawals?\n\nNeed some London student hacking to keep you going until 2016?\n\nLuckily for you, our friends at KCL Tech are running HackKing's.
